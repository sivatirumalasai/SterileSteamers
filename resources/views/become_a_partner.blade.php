                            <span class="template-padding-reset template-align-left">Our 3 Franchise Business Models: </span>
                            <span class="template-padding-reset template-align-left">Model A: Free Standing Auto Detail Shop </span>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            We have agreements with many parking garages around the country that allow our franchisees access to their facilities. Once in, they can offer our supreme detailing services to anyone who uses the facility.
                            <br>
                            Alternatively, they can also select to lease or build an auto detailing bay facility.
                            <br>
                            Franchisees choosing the first of our franchise business models operate only from a free standing location. In most cases, we will pre-negotiate it for them. The original franchise agreement allows them to have an unlimited number of auto detail shops within their franchise territory. Thus, they have the ability to grow at their own pace.
                        </p>
                        <div class="template-component-header-subheader">

                        </div>
                        <p>
                            The second of our franchise business models entails the operation of a mobile detailing unit to deliver services to customers at a time and place of their choice. Model B is more flexible and scalable than Model A. Additionally, clients appreciate the mobility and the convenience of getting services at a time and location they choose.
                        </p>
                        <div class="template-component-header-subheader">

                        </div>
                        <p>
                            This option allows the franchisee to increase their coverage and grow their income potential by having mobile detailing units that go to the customers’ places of business or residence. This is in addition to the free standing auto detail shop as described in Model A. This is the most complex of our franchise business models that calls for an experienced entrepreneur to manage it effectively.
